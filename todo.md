## now

- lambda mart but change each group to be from one click/scroll to the next
- add another feature: is under cwd
- things go kinda wrong when i call it from my root homedir. too many files. it freezes.

## not now, maybe never
- use tracing subscriber crate so we can have nice spans of time and we can maybe visualize and optimize idk
