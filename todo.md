## now

- add is_hidden: has hidden dir component
- get rid of the option of there being no ranker, or ranker not working. that's a hard crash.
- things go kinda wrong when i call it from my root homedir. too many files. it freezes.

## not now, maybe never
- use tracing subscriber crate so we can have nice spans of time and we can maybe visualize and optimize idk
