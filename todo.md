- automated tests that can be run using cargo test, in test modules in each file.
- keyboard shortcut to just clear current search, maybe just Ctrl-a Ctrl-k
- when we scroll below current page of results it should scroll properly with us, maybe as it gets to bottom 5 it should start scrolling with us
- in addition to the walkdir from current dir, also include in the results list any file we've ever clicked or scrolled before.
- the modification time shown in results list isn't properly right justified. so when filenames are different lengths then they don't all appear nicely in a column.
