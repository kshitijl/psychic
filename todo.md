- put in log statement of "started sg in directory {cwd}, session {}"
- put trained model output file next to the db file. and look for it there in the tui code.
- keyboard shortcut to just clear current search, maybe just Ctrl-a Ctrl-k? can we easily get normal readline stuff to work or no?
- when we scroll below current page of results it should scroll properly with us, maybe as it gets to bottom 5 it should start scrolling with us
- in addition to the walkdir from current dir, also include in the results list any file we've ever clicked or scrolled before.
- the modification time shown in results list isn't properly right justified. so when filenames are different lengths then they don't all appear nicely in a column.
- get rid of the clone in ranker.rank_files. it should just take a ref. no?
- use tracing subscriber crate so we can have nice spans of time and we can maybe visualize and optimize idk
