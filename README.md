## psychic

`psychic` is a terminal-based file browser with ML-powered ranking, built in Rust using ratatui. It learns from user behavior (clicks, scrolls) to improve search relevance over time. Inspired by `fzf` and `zoxide`, `psychic` helps you navigate the filesystem and open the files you need, *fast*.

## Installation

You'll need the rust toolchain and a recent version of CMake. Then,

`cargo install --path .`
